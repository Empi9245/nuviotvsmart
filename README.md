## Get Nuvio TV

Nuvio TV supports **Samsung Tizen TVs from 2018 onward (Tizen 4+)**, **LG webOS TVs from 2020 onward (webOS 5+)**, and **Hisense VIDAA OS (Experimental Port)**.
The startup compatibility baseline is Samsung Tizen 4.0 / Chromium 56, LG webOS 5.0 / Chromium 68, and Hisense VIDAA OS (Chromium / WebKit runtime).

Platform capabilities are intentionally version-dependent:

- **Hisense VIDAA OS (New Port)** — Full TV remote control navigation (D-pad, Back, Exit, media keys), TV viewport scaling, native hardware video playback, and a dedicated local web installer (`installer/`).

- **Samsung Tizen 4.x** — the app and direct playback are supported, but torrent/P2P playback is unavailable by design. Some advanced audio and subtitle features may also be limited.
- **Samsung Tizen 5.x, including 5.5** — torrent/P2P playback is supported through the bundled local EngineFS service only. The PluginService, plugin execution, and remote plugin pull/push synchronization are disabled; the Plugins screen is not available.
  The Node 4.4.3 service runtime observed on Tizen 5.5 is incompatible with the current PluginService syntax and URL APIs. Experimental legacy transports are not included; plugin support starts at Tizen 6.0.
- **Samsung Tizen 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged PluginService are supported. Plugin execution requires the packaged service plus the TV runtime's Worker and WebAssembly support. Tizen 6 and later use the same current Tizen service pipeline.
- **LG webOS 5.x** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported, with the limited plugin resource quotas used by the older webOS runtime.
- **LG webOS 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported with the modern plugin resource quotas.

On Tizen 5+ and LG webOS, torrent/P2P uses only the bundled local companion service; no external torrent streaming server is configured or required.

- [Hisense VIDAA Web Installer](./installer) for local network installation
- [Nuvio TV Installer](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [Samsung Tizen WGT](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation
- [LG webOS Homebrew repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVWebOS/main/webosbrew/apps.json)
- [LG webOS IPK](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derpwinnie/NuvioTVSmart.git NuvioTVSmart
cd NuvioTVSmart
npm install
npm run build
```

Build TV packages with:

```bash
npm run package:tizen
npm run package:tizen:store
npm run package:webos
npm run package:vidaa
```

To test and run the VIDAA version locally:

```bash
npm run test:vidaa   # Run VIDAA adapter & platform test suite
npm run serve:vidaa  # Start local VIDAA development server
```

`package:tizen` creates the unsigned WGT used by development and the Nuvio TV Installer. The installer signs it locally for the target TV before installation. `package:tizen:store` is a separate Seller Office build: it requires Tizen Studio/Web CLI and a configured security profile, and creates the signed Store package with the local EngineFS service included so Tizen 5+ retains torrent/P2P playback. Tizen 4 still reports P2P as unsupported at runtime. Nuvio TV is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and platform TV APIs. Building requires Node.js and npm; package installation additionally requires the relevant Tizen or webOS tools.
